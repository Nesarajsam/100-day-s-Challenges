  <h1>My First Blog Post</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my blog! Today, I want to share some <strong>important</strong> thoughts about learning HTML. 
    Writing code consistently is the <em>best way</em> to improve your skills.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes, we <b>overthink</b> and forget that practice matters more than theory. 
    <i>Just write code daily!</i> Even if it’s small.
  </p>

  <p>
    A tip: keep your notes short and <mark>highlight the key points</mark> so you can review quickly. 
    And don’t worry if you make mistakes — I once wrote “Hello Wrold” instead of “Hello World” 
    and had to <del>cry for 2 hours</del> laugh about it. Mistakes are part of learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fun fact: Water is written as H<sub>2</sub>O, and math can be cool too —
    like 2<sup>3</sup> = 8. 
  </p>

  <p>
    To wrap up: <strong>Keep coding</strong>, <em>keep experimenting</em>, 
    and never forget to <mark>enjoy the journey</mark>
